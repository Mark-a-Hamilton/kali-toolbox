# 🧰 tool-template

`tool-template` is the foundational scaffold for all future `tool-*` scripts in the Kali Toolbox. It enforces consistent structure, metadata, and modular flag parsing to ensure auditability, clarity, and contributor ease.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This template is designed to:

- Provide a consistent starting point for new tools
- Embed standardized metadata blocks for indexing and traceability
- Support dry-run, verbose, and audit-grade logging out of the box
- Enable AI-assisted script generation with minimal post-editing

---

## 🧪 Usage

To create a new tool script:

1. Copy `tool-template` to your desired filename:
   ```bash
   cp tool-template tool-mynewtool
   ```
2. Edit the metadata block at the top:
   ```bash
   # Script Purpose: Describe what this tool does
   # Version: 1.0
   ```
3. Implement your logic within the `main()` function.
4. Use `parse_flags()` to handle `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, etc.
5. Validate with `tool-index` to ensure metadata is parsed correctly.

## 🧭 Contributor Guidance

- Always start with `tool-template` to ensure consistency
- Document your tool’s purpose and version clearly
- Use modular functions and avoid hardcoded paths
- Validate output formatting and metadata with `tool-index`
