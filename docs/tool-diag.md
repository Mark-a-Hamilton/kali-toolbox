# 🩺 tool-diag

`tool-diag` is a modular diagnostics and system health tool for Kali Linux. It performs checks on uptime, memory, disk usage, and service status, with optional dry-run, logging, and hash-based traceability.

---

## 📦 Purpose

This tool helps assess system health and operational readiness by:

- Reporting uptime, memory, and disk usage
- Checking service status (e.g. Neo4j, BloodHound)
- Logging diagnostics with timestamps
- Generating SHA-256 hashes for audit trails

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Diagnostics
```bash
tool-diag
```
Runs all diagnostic checks directly.

### Dry-Run Mode
```bash
tool-diag --dry-run
```
Simulates diagnostics without executing commands.

### With Logging
```bash
tool-diag --log
```
Appends diagnostic results to `/var/log/tool-diag.log`.

### With Hash-Based Audit
```bash
tool-diag --hashmap
```
Generates a SHA-256 hash of the script and logs the timestamp to `.hashmap/`.
