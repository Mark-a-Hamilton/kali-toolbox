# ü©∫ kali-diagnostics

The `kali-diagnostics` script is a modular wrapper for basic system diagnostics in Kali Linux. It checks service status, network connectivity, and system health, with optional logging and hash-based traceability.

---

## üì¶ Purpose

This script provides quick visibility into system status by:
- Checking key services
- Validating network connectivity
- Reporting uptime and resource usage
- Logging actions and hashing for audit-grade traceability

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic diagnostics

```bash
kali-diagnostics
```

Runs all checks with no logging or simulation.

### Dry-run mode

```bash
kali-diagnostics --dry-run
```

Simulates each check without executing.

### With logging

```bash
kali-diagnostics --log
```

Appends execution details to `/var/log/kali-diagnostics.log`.

### With hash-based audit

```bash
kali-diagnostics --hashmap
```

Generates a SHA-256 hash of the script and logs the timestamp to `.hashmap/`.
