# 🧭 Ethics and Responsible Use

This document outlines the ethical principles that guide the design, use, and contribution to the **Kali-toolbox** project. It reinforces the project's commitment to transparency, auditability, and non-intrusive system maintenance.

---

## 🧰 Project Philosophy

Kali-toolbox is built on the belief that system tooling should be:
- **Transparent**: Every script wraps existing system commands with no hidden behavior.
- **Auditable**: Logging and hashing are supported to ensure traceability.
- **Non-intrusive**: No script performs scanning, enumeration, or external interaction.
- **User-empowering**: Documentation is written for clarity and accessibility.

---

## 🚫 What This Project Is Not

Kali-toolbox is **not**:
- A penetration testing suite
- A red teaming or offensive security toolkit
- A reconnaissance or enumeration framework

It does not include any tools or logic that:
- Interact with external systems
- Probe networks or services
- Exploit vulnerabilities

---

## ✅ Intended Use

This project is intended solely for:
- **System maintenance** on Kali Linux
- **Operational hygiene** (updates, diagnostics, cleanup)
- **Passive diagnostics** with optional logging and audit support

All functionality is designed to be safe, local, and ethically bounded.

---

## 🔐 Audit and Consent

To support ethical use:
- Scripts include optional logging (`--log`) and hashing (`--hashmap`) for traceability.
- Users are encouraged to run scripts only on systems where they have **explicit permission**.
- Contributors must ensure all additions maintain ethical clarity and avoid misuse potential.

---

## 🤝 Contributor Guidelines

When contributing:
- Avoid adding any functionality that could be misused for scanning, probing, or exploitation.
- Document all scripts clearly, including purpose, usage, and expected output.
- Use modular wrappers and flags to maintain transparency and user control.

## 📢 Disclaimer

This project provides wrappers for existing system commands. It does **not** include any tools for reconnaissance, exploitation, or offensive security.

Use responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission.
