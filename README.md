# 🧰 Kali-toolbox

**Kali-toolbox** is a modular collection of utility scripts designed to assist in maintaining and managing a Kali Linux installation. These tools wrap existing system commands to streamline routine tasks such as updates, diagnostics, and hygiene checks—without introducing new security functionality.

> ⚠️ This project is not a penetration testing suite or offensive security toolkit. It is intended solely for system maintenance and operational support.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Kali-toolbox provides a centralized, auditable set of helper scripts that:
- Simplify common administrative tasks
- Enhance operational hygiene
- Maintain ethical clarity in tooling

Each script is designed to be globally accessible when installed to `/usr/local/bin`, and includes internal documentation for usage and logging.

---

## 🎯 Scope and Intended Use

This project is scoped exclusively for:
- **System maintenance** on Kali Linux
- **Operational hygiene** (updates, diagnostics, cleanup)
- **Wrapper logic** for existing system commands

It does **not** include reconnaissance, exploitation, or offensive tooling. All functionality is designed to be transparent, auditable, and ethically bounded.
