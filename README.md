# 🧰 Kali-toolbox

**Kali-toolbox** is a modular collection of utility scripts designed to assist in maintaining and managing a Kali Linux installation. These tools wrap existing system commands to streamline routine tasks such as updates, diagnostics, and hygiene checks—without introducing new security functionality.

> ⚠️ This project is not a penetration testing suite or offensive security toolkit. It is intended solely for system maintenance and operational support.

## 📦 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a centralized, auditable set of helper scripts that:
- Simplify common administrative tasks
- Enhance operational hygiene
- Maintain clarity and ethical boundaries in tooling

Scripts are designed to be installed in `/usr/local/bin` for global access across the system.
